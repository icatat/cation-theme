I was born and raised in Oradea, Romania, in a normal family. I discovered my passion for Art when I was about 4 years old and my mom used to draw for me. At the age of 8, I started drawing myself, mostly Christian Orthodox glass painting (not very religious myself though). I further discovered oils, graphics, acrylics and water colors. Gaining a varied portfolio, I opened my first personal exhibition called <b><i>Fear of being Brave</i></b> in 2011, at the age of 14, dreaming of pursuing a career in Arts.

I was powerfully dreamy and confident.

I attended a Computer Science & Mathematics high-school, where things turned 180 degrees. Due to a series of external factors, I decided to study in the United States. I was lucky enough to be awarded enough financial aid to open a door to a new future. I came to United States for college in 2015. However, not being privileged enough, switched my career pursuits to something more "realistic".

I discovered creativity in Software Engineering, which made it a "realistic" path that fit me. I interned in Silicon Valley and I am currently a Software Engineer in New York City.

My dreams are still as big as ever, and I am trying to make my Art "come-back".
