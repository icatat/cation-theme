I was born and raised in <b style='color:white'>Oradea, Romania</b>, in a so-called "normal" family. I discovered my passion for <b style='color:white'>Art</b> when I was about <b style='color:white'>4 years old</b> and my mom used to draw for me. At the age of <b style='color:white'>8</b>, I started drawing myself, mostly <b style='color:white'>Christian Orthodox glass paintings </b>(not very religious myself though). I further discovered <b style='color:white'>oils, graphics, acrylics and water colors</b>. Gaining a varied portfolio, I opened my first personal exhibition called <b style='color:white'>"Fear of being Brave" in 2011, at the age of 14</b>, dreaming of pursuing a career in Arts.

I was powerfully dreamy and confident.

I attended a <b style='color:white'>Computer Science & Mathematics</b> high-school, where things turned 180 degrees. Due to a series of external factors, I decided to study in the <b style='color:white'>United States</b>. I was lucky enough to be awarded enough financial aid to open a door to a new future. I came to <b style='color:white'>United States</b> for college in <b style='color:white'>2015</b>. However, not being privileged enough, switched my career pursuits to something more "realistic".

I discovered creativity in <b style='color:white'>Software Engineering</b>, which made it a "realistic" path that fit me. I interned in <b style='color:white'>Silicon Valley</b> and I am currently a <b style='color:white'>Software Engineer</b> in <b style='color:white'>New York City</b>.

My dreams are still as big as ever, and I am trying to make my Art "come-back".
